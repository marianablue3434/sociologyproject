  <h2>Newspaper</h2>
  <p>INDIVIDUAL</p>
  <p>The newspaper is a common one-to-many form of communication. The newspaper company publishes a daily, weekly or monthly copy of their news. The physical, tangible piece of paper makes the headlines seem shocking and eye-catching. Although headlines are meant to catch the reader's attention, the meaning and content of the newspaper seems real in correlation with a palpable material in between their fingertips. This medium, rather than the internet has a more lasting effect on the individual as the print news culture is exiting the world, paving the way for internet news and a digital age. Although the newspaper cannot update live as the television does, it impacts the overall feeling the reader has towards the financial crisis and worries them about their future. Print news was still a way that people could be informed about the crash of investment bank, Lehman Brothers, seen in The Wall Street Journal below. 
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>SOCIETY<br/><br/>
Society as a whole is also affected by the newspaper headlines more so than the medium of which the news is delivered. Although Marshall McLuhan catched the phrase, “The medium is the message,” headlines are meant to catch attention for the reader to pick it up. Headlines impact society because they can blow an event out of proportion, making the crisis feel bigger than it actually is. But the medium could possibly affect society by sending a bigger message that the newspaper can still be a means of communication, even in a digital era of obtaining information at a rapid rate. The effects of the United States market crashes and creates fear in the world economy, as seen in the Wall Street Journal newspaper below.

  <h2>Television News</h2>
  <p>INDIVIDUAL<br/><br/> The television is a very powerful medium in the age of financial crisis’ as live updating and ‘breaking news’ is delivered as fast as possible to the viewer. The everyday news segment on the local news portrayed more images than the newspaper but showed vague news about the day’s latest updates. The news on television from stations such as CNN and CNBC make a viewer concerned for their retirement and savings because so many different topics are covered on live broadcasts and talk shows. Financial help was offered, making the viewer worry and take action in other ways to recover from the crisis. Tickers at the bottom of the television screen could bring anxiety to an individual who is already stressed. Personal stories would also be shared, making the individual be able to relate to other people’s stories contributes to the ideology a person has. Whether someone has already felt the impact in their bank accounts or not they are made aware of the impact it has on other people in the country. This raises concerns for having to push back retirement, meaning that more individuals would be working longer. Television news changed and influenced the amount of news that people were gaining as well as their habits, which increased the amount of time individuals watched the television. 
<br/><br/>SOCIETY<br/><br/>Since the television has become the center of consumer culture, the one-to-many form of communication influenced the viewing practices of Americans as well as the culture of receiving information. As different countries watch the same news and information that is going on in the government and market of the United States their ideology shifts as they see and are warned of the effects that it can cause to their country. Analysts and news broadcasting describe the US economy and its effects as their economy is eventually affected as well from the crisis. “Cultural practices shaped it’s early development and uses, just as the medium in turn influenced these practices” (305). Although the television had emerged decades before 2008, the quote demonstrates how this crisis changed and shaped the use of the television. Although the beginning of the crisis started in the US economy, the television allowed people from different countries the same information that was broadcasted. Other countries were receiving the same information and warnings readily, which disrupts the manner which different countries view the television. The 24 hour news networks allowed people to turn the tv at 1 am in London while it was 8 pm in New York and learn something new about the markets. Since the television at this point has become a “daily habit” (305) people stay up-to-date and informed which in turn raises concern and speculation towards the US economy.

  <h2>The Internet</h2>
  <div class="illustration"></div>
  <p>INDIVIDUAL<br/><br/>The Internet was a crucial part in shaping how people were affected by the 2008 financial crisis. Since the Internet is a readily available source of information and content, people can turn to the internet at all time of day, during their job, at home, while at the dinner table. 39% of individuals worried about stability of banks from what they read on the internet. This can be attributed to the fact that online news articles go more in depth on the significance and importance of the crisis rather than traditional television news. Individuals turned to the internet for additional resources as well as 41% of individuals looked for jobs online as a response to the online news they were reading. The Internet is subject to social forces to shape it, such as heightening market pressures, which lowered confidence levels. The uptick and desperation of some people was created by the Internet which in turn led them to look for jobs online, further using the medium. The one-to-one medium allows the individual to be alone, interacting and scrolling through the news, which endorsed the crisis by uncensoring the news. The constant stream of information makes the individual worried and concerned about their own economic future as well as their family’s. 
<br/><br/>SOCIETY<br/><br/> During the financial crisis 30% of people went online more often. Since the internet was updated more often than the newspaper, this craving for more knowledge and heightened stress of the future led society to turn to the internet more often. This medium affected society as a whole by creating a different and more informed culture of people. 37% of people worried more about their economic future during the recession and due to the use of the internet. Although the internet contains a wealth of information, it is much different than the newspaper because not all headlines are disproportionate, and are not as concise. This makes society more informed as a whole and more prone to read information that is false as well.

  <h2>Political Cartoons</h2>
  <p>INDIVIDUAL<br/><br/>
Although political cartoons are not at the forefront when one thinks of a type of media, they frame a different story and experience than a written text, especially during the financial crisis. Some political cartoons are comedic, but show the individual a deeper meaning. The one-to-many communication demonstrates through some text and drawings the effects that the economy is having on an individual, for example the first image below shows how investment banks are crashing and need help by illustrating a “humpty dumpty” image, and the Fed appearing to save them.  Some of the Fed “workers” drawn in soldier suits appear to be having a leisurely time, not caring. Although this isn’t the truth behind the situation, it brings comedy to an outsider’s perspective of the government and the economy. The second image to the right demonstrates a man who is an optimist reading an article in the newspaper about the economic depression on Wall Street. In the man’s dreams the downturn will draw to a close. This political cartoon describing the ideology that people have in a sarcastic way by reinforcing their beliefs in that the end is nowhere near.  <img src="https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/migrated/D3808WW0.jpg" width="350" height="250">
   <img src= "http://www.theeditorialcartoons.com/properties/luckovich/art_images/lk1081010_lr.jpg" width="350" height="250"><br/><br/>SOCIETY <br/><br/> Although these cartoons show a serious meaning, society is affected by the same cartoons when seen online or in the newspaper by thinking that the whole world will crash and burn as shown in the text of the first image. The second cartoon shows that the subprime mortgages have led to the fall of the world economy. This heightens worries, but also demonstrates it in a non-traditional way - art. As a whole, society is affected by political cartoons because they share truths that people have towards the government or ideas, which reinforces their beliefs as well. Looking at color in the picture can cause emotion to erupt, or the black and white can signify the gloominess of the situation that is occuring. <br></br> <img src="https://www.conservapedia.com/images/thumb/5/58/CRASH08.JPG/330px-CRASH08.JPG" width="360" height="260">
